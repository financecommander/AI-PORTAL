# Branch Structure

This repository uses the following branch structure:

- **main** - The main production branch
- **develop** - The development branch for ongoing work

## Setup Commands

The repository has been initialized with both branches:

```bash
git checkout -b main
git checkout -b develop
```

Both branches (`main` and `develop`) are now available for use in the repository. The `develop` branch is used for integrating features before they are merged to `main` for production releases.
